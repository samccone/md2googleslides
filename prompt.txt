What follows wrapped in <SPEC> and terminated by </SPEC> is the supported syntax to create a slide deck.

    ## Slides

    Each slide is typically represented by a header, followed by zero or more block elements.

    Begin a new slide with a horizontal rule (`---`). The separator
    may be omitted for the first slide.

    The following examples show how to create slides of various layouts:

    ### Supported slide formats

    #### Title slide

    <pre>
        ---

        # This is a title slide
        ## Your name here
    </pre>

    #### Section title slides

    <pre>
        ---

        # This is a section title
    </pre>


    #### Section title & body slides

    <pre>
        ---

        # Section title & body slide

        ## This is a subtitle

        This is the body
    </pre>


    #### Title & body slides

    <pre>
        ---

        # Title & body slide

        This is the slide body.
    </pre>


    #### Main point slide

    Add `{.big}` to the title to make a slide with one big point

    <pre>
        ---

        # This is the main point {.big}
    </pre>


    #### Big number slide

    Use `{.big}` on a header in combination with a body too.

    <pre>
        ---

        # 100% {.big}

        This is the body
    </pre>


    #### Big text slide

    Use `{.big}` on a `#` header in combination with no body.

    <pre>
        ---

        # 100% {.big}
    </pre>

    #### Two column slides

    Separate columns with `{.column}`. The marker must appear
    on its own line with a blank both before and after.

    <pre>
        ---

        # Two column layout

        This is the left column

        {.column}

        This is the right column
    </pre>

    ### Images

    #### Inline images

    Images can be placed on slides using image tags. Multiple images can be included. Mulitple images in a single paragraph are arranged in columns, multiple paragraphs arranged as rows. **NOTE:** Images are currently scaled and centered to fit the
    slide template.

    <pre>
        ---

        # Slides can have images
        ![](https://placehold.co/400x200/CCCCCC/000000?text=Some Text)
    </pre>

    #### Background images

    Set the background image of a slide by adding `{.background}` to
    the end of an image URL.

    <pre>
        ---

        # Slides can have background images

        
        ![](https://placehold.co/400x200/CCCCCC/000000.png?text=Some Text){.background}
    </pre>

    ### Videos

    Include YouTube videos with a modified image tag.

    <pre>
        ---

        # Slides can have videos

        @[youtube](MG8KADiRbOU)
    </pre>

    ### Speaker notes

    Include speaker notes for a slide using HTML comments. Text inside
    the comments may include markdown for formatting, though only text
    formatting is allowed. Videos, images, and tables are ignored inside
    speaker notes.

    <pre>
        ---

        # Slide title

        ![](https://placehold.co/400x200/CCCCCC/000000.png?text=Some Text){.background}

        &lt;!--
        These are speaker notes.
        --&gt;
    </pre>

    ### Formatting

    Basic formatting rules are allowed, including:

    * Bold
    * Italics
    * Code
    * Strikethrough
    * Hyperlinks
    * Ordered lists
    * Unordered lists

    The following markdown illustrates a few common styles.

    <pre>
    **Bold**, *italics*, and ~~strikethrough~~ may be used.

    Ordered lists:
    1. Item 1
    1. Item 2
    1. Item 2.1

    Unordered lists:
    * Item 1
    * Item 2
    * Item 2.1
    </pre>

    You **CAN NOT** mix ordered and unordered lists when nesting lists. For example this is invalid:
    <pre>
    * Item 1
        1. INVALID Item 1.1
    * Item 2
        2. INVALID Item 2.1
    </pre>

    Additionally, a subset of inline HTML tags are supported for styling.

    * `<span>`
    * `<sup>`
    * `<sub>`
    * `<em>`
    * `<i>`
    * `<strong>`
    * `<b>`

    Supported CSS styles for use with `<span>` elements:

    * `color`
    * `background-color`
    * `font-weight: bold`
    * `font-style: italic`
    * `text-decoration: underline`
    * `text-decoration: line-through`
    * `font-family`
    * `font-variant: small-caps`
    * `font-size` (must use points for units)

    You may also use `{style="..."}` [attributes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-attrs)
    after markdown elements to apply styles. This can be used on headers, inline
    elements, code blocks, etc.

    ### Code blocks

    Both indented and fenced code blocks are supported, with syntax highlighting.

    The following example renders highlighted code.

    <pre>
    ### Hello World

    ```javascript
    console.log('Hello world');
    ```
    </pre>

    ### Tables

    Tables are supported via
    [GFM](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) syntax.

    Note: Including tables and other block elements on the same slide may produce poor results with
    overlapping elements. Either avoid or manually adjust the layout after generating the slides.

    The following generates a 2x5 table on the slide.

    <pre>
    ### Top pets in the United States

    Animal | Number

    Fish   | 142 million
    Cats   | 88 million
    Dogs   | 75 million
